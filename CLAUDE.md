# FTCSim project notes

Desktop simulator for FTC robot code (see README.md for usage). Key facts for working on it:

## Build / run
- `./gradlew run -Prepo=<repo>`; dev loop: `tools/dev-run.sh <repo> <port> [--samples]` then
  `node tools/wsclient.mjs <port> <OpMode> [s]`, `node tools/run-all.mjs <port> [s] [regex]`
  (`RUN_DISABLED=1` includes @Disabled OpModes), `node tools/ui-test.mjs <port>` (Playwright, needs
  `tools/node_modules -> /opt/node22/lib/node_modules` symlink or a local Playwright install).
- The SDK version is read from the repo's `build.dependencies.gradle` (`org.firstinspires.ftc:RobotCore:x`).
  Both 11.0.0 and 12.0.0 must compile: `./gradlew :sim:compileJava` and
  `./gradlew :sim:compileJava -Prepo=<sdk12 repo>`. SDK 12 differences handled so far: `ServoControllerEx`
  pulse width methods, `ServoController.forgetLastKnownPosition`, `AprilTagDetection` abstract with
  `AprilTagSingleDetection` (constructed reflectively), Gamepad trigger thresholds.
- Unit tests: `./gradlew test` (`ChassisTest`, `MotorDirectionTest`). Tests that need Pedro on the
  classpath are not kept (the test classpath only has Pedro when `-Prepo` points at a repo using it).
- Scratch checkouts used during development live in the session scratchpad (`decode`, `ftcrc`, `pedro`).

- Java toolchain (root build.gradle.kts): the JVM running Gradle is used when it is a JDK >= 17 with a
  compiler; otherwise a JDK 21 toolchain (installed or foojay-downloaded) compiles and runs everything.
  `-Pftcsim.jdk=N` forces a version. api.foojay.io is blocked in the sandbox, so test the download path
  only on a real machine; `-Pftcsim.jdk=21` exercises the installed-JDK path here.

## Architecture rules
- Real SDK classes are used wherever possible; only hardware/Android-bound classes are shadowed
  (list in `ftc-sdk/shadowed-classes.txt`; the shadow must live at the same FQN in `sim/`).
  Nested classes of a shadowed class are stripped too, so a shadow must re-declare them.
- `MotorState.physicalSign = mountSign * orientationSign`. The SDK inverts raw power/encoder sign for
  CCW motor types (goBILDA, REV HD Hex); `MotorType.ccw` mirrors that. Never set `physicalSign` directly.
- Frames: FTC field frame (center origin; +X to the right when the goal wall is on the left, +Y up,
  CCW heading; `Field.decode()` places the goal tags at x = -58.37). Pedro: `pedro_x = FTC_y + 72`,
  `pedro_y = 72 - FTC_x`, `FTC_heading = pedro_heading + 90°` (see `SimHardware.snapTo`, app.js
  `toPedro`/`fromPedro`). Tag library quaternions: the tag's local +Z points INTO the tag face.
- Hub PIDF emulation: `PidfController`, 16-bit output units, I/D scaled by `HUB_LOOP_HZ` (20), integral
  zero-crossing reset. Default velocity coefficients F = 32767/maxTps, P = 0.1F, I = 0.01F.
- OpMode runner: an Error in the OpMode thread is caught through `RobotLog.threadPoolErrorHook`
  (the SDK's ThreadPool only logs it). INIT after an emergency stop restarts the robot automatically.
- VisionPortal: `VisionPortalImpl` runs a 30 Hz loop driving `SimVisionProcessor`s;
  `AprilTagProcessorImpl` computes detections from `SimVision` (true pose + field + camera mount from
  the `WebcamName` config entry or `setCameraPose`). No camera frames exist.
- Unknown I2C driver classes are instantiated on `VirtualI2cDevice` (reads return zeros); interfaces map
  to drivers through `SimHardware.I2C_IMPLS` (OctoQuad). Legacy `BNO055IMU` has a real model (`SimBNO055IMU`).
- Android `R` classes: `ftc-sdk` generates `<aar package>.R` + `ftcsim.generated.ResourceNames` from each
  AAR's `R.txt` / `res/values/values.xml` (task `generateR`); `Main` installs the string resolver so
  `getDeviceName()` etc. return the SDK's English strings.
- SDK 12's `AprilTagGameDatabase.getCurrentGameTagLibrary()` returns unplaced sample tags (583-586), so the
  official AprilTag samples detect nothing on the DECODE field; Decode (SDK 11) uses the DECODE library.
- Sweep results are kept in `build/*-sweep*.log`; `ClassFactory.getInstance()` is `SimClassFactory`.

## Conventions
- Commit messages: plain description, no model identifiers.
- Do not use the Frontend Design skill unless asked. UI is vanilla JS/CSS in `sim/src/main/resources/web`.
